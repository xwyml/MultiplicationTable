## Introduction
   This project paints a Multiplication Table or a Addition Table depending on the input from command line.

Or you can just use the m.jar I made in this folder.
## Operation
   Please follow the command line's instructions and input positive integers for x and y, Then choose one from the Multiplication    Table and the Addition Table for painting.
